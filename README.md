# API Project: File Metadata Microservice

### User stories :

1. I can submit a form object that includes a file upload.
2. The from file input field has the "name" attribute set to "upfile". We rely on this in testing.
3. When I submit something, I will receive the file name, and size in bytes within the JSON response.

#### Example output:
* `{"name":"0-weu-d2-a7b78f29640b706bf757cf2510ca75cd.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","size":133159}`
